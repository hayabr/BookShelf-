# BookShelf (fluttee UI)
BookShelf is a Flutter-based frontend UI prototype for a book browsing mobile application. It showcases a visually appealing and responsive interface for exploring books, displaying details such as titles, prices, ratings, and categories, and managing favorites. The app includes pages for home, store, favorites, and book details, designed with a focus on clean UI/UX and modular code. While non-interactive in terms of core functionality (e.g., no actual book reading), BookShelf demonstrates proficiency in Flutter for crafting modern, user-friendly mobile interfaces.
